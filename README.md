## From Zarqa

**Adding two stars at the start of the sentence and the end of it will add bold style**

If we needed to quote some one you must use > for example: My wise friend once said 
>lol

To express your feeling using emoji you should use github emoji code like :smile: to express that you are smiling

***to use bold and italic style for all the sentence use triple star at the end and the beginning of the sentence***

i did it more than once but if u need new paragraph just leave blank line

:D :+1:
