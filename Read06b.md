# How Computers Work
**Everyone uses a some kind of computer these days so its essential to know atleast the working principles which make a computer**

## What's make a Computer, a Computer
anyworking computer uses for priciples which are
1. inputting data to interact with the Computer using input devices like mouse keyboared etc.
2. store data in memory as binary which was sent from an input device
3. process acoording a series of commands in the processor
4. output depends on the purpose of the machine 

## Bibary&data
data is repsented using electricity and electrical circuits
electricity can be in the on state i.e. the 1 state or the off state i.e. the 0 state

So in binary we have two numbers 0&1 any information can be repressnted using binary for example text can be represented by giving each letter a unique number to each letter
and the same goes for images and sound
## Circuits and Logic
Computers uses million sof tiny circuits which come togther to form circuits some circuits flips on state to off stae and vice versa
the following picture show some logic circuits ![Logical circuits](https://gyandakids.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/logic-gate1.jpg?w=584) and these simple circuits can form more comlicated circuits like an adder circuit
